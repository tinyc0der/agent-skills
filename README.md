# Agent Skills

**Production-grade engineering skills for AI coding agents.**

Skills encode the workflows, quality gates, and best practices that senior engineers use when building software. These ones are packaged so AI agents follow them consistently across every phase of development.

## Commands

11 slash commands map to lifecycle phases or focused specialist workflows. Each activates the right skills automatically.

| What you're doing | Command | Key principle |
|-------------------|---------|---------------|
| Define what to build | `/spec` | Spec before code |
| Plan how to build it | `/plan` | Small, atomic tasks |
| Open or ready a pull request | `/pr draft`, `/pr ready` | Visible early, ready only with current evidence |
| Build incrementally | `/build` | One slice at a time |
| Verify the assembled feature | `/verify` | Acceptance criteria require evidence |
| Develop behavior test-first | `/test` | Red-Green-Refactor |
| Set the quality bar | `/constraints` | Decide it once, enforce it everywhere |
| Review before merge | `/review` | Improve code health |
| Audit web performance | `/webperf` | Measure before you optimize |
| Simplify the code | `/code-simplify` | Clarity over cleverness |
| Ship to production | `/ship` | Faster is safer |

Migration note: older examples used `/test` after `/build`. Keep `/test` for
RED-GREEN-REFACTOR while implementing behavior; use `/verify` after the assembled
feature is complete. Antigravity and Gemini name `/plan` as `/planning`, but the
lifecycle and artifacts are identical.

**`/build` runs the authorized scope autonomously**, with `/build auto` and `/build all` as aliases. Use `/build step` for one task. Required plans and checkpoints are checked without repeated approval: behavioral slices use the minimum-sufficient test gate and RED-GREEN-REFACTOR, every slice is verified and committed, and failures enter debugging. Human gates are reserved for material decisions, access/authority, or consequential risks the agent cannot resolve itself. Existing scope and release/merge authorization limits still apply.

Multiple valid approaches stay autonomous when established intent and delegated judgment settle the choice. Unresolved consequential trade-offs need options and a recommendation. Active outages, suspected compromise, and ongoing data loss need prompt notification even while authorized fixes continue. See the [human attention policy](skills/using-agent-skills/SKILL.md#autonomous-execution-and-critical-human-gates) for decision requests, urgent notices, and resumption.

Skills also activate automatically based on what you're doing — designing an API triggers `api-and-interface-design`, building UI triggers `frontend-ui-engineering`, and so on.

## Quick Start

**Fastest path — any agent, one command.** The open [skills CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) installs into 70+ agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Copilot, Cline, and more):

```bash
npx skills add tinyc0der/agent-skills            # install all 30 skills
npx skills add tinyc0der/agent-skills --list     # browse before installing
```

Or grab individual skills:

```bash
npx skills add tinyc0der/agent-skills --skill code-review-and-quality   # five-axis review before merge
npx skills add tinyc0der/agent-skills --skill interview-me              # requirements interrogation, one question at a time
npx skills add tinyc0der/agent-skills --skill test-case-design-review   # lean test design, pruning, and review
npx skills add tinyc0der/agent-skills --skill test-driven-development   # red-green-refactor, enforced
```

> **Installing one skill?** A per-skill `npx` install copies only
> `skills/<name>/`, not the repo-level `references/` directory. Every skill keeps
> its required workflow and exit criteria in `SKILL.md`; repo-level references are
> optional, expanded guidance for whole-pack installs. Copy a shared checklist
> into the installed skill only when you want that additional detail.

Prefer a native integration? Pick your tool below.

<details>
<summary><b>Claude Code (recommended)</b></summary>

**Marketplace install:**

```
/plugin marketplace add tinyc0der/agent-skills
/plugin install agent-skills@tinyc0der-agent-skills
```

> **SSH errors?** The marketplace clones repos via SSH. If you don't have SSH keys set up on GitHub, either [add your SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) or use the full HTTPS URL to force HTTPS cloning during the marketplace-add step:
> ```bash
> /plugin marketplace add https://github.com/tinyc0der/agent-skills.git
> /plugin install agent-skills@tinyc0der-agent-skills
> ```
>
> If `/plugin install` still fails with `git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey)` on Windows or macOS, the recommended workaround is to configure Git once to rewrite GitHub SSH URLs to HTTPS for subprocess clones:
> ```bash
> git config --global url."https://github.com/".insteadOf git@github.com:
> ```

**Local / development:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tinyc0der/agent-skills.git
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/agent-skills
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Cursor</b></summary>

Put workflow skills under `.cursor/skills/` (sync from `agent-skills/skills/`) and short policies in `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` — do not paste full skills into rules. See [docs/cursor-setup.md](docs/cursor-setup.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Antigravity CLI</b></summary>

Install as a native plugin for skills and subagents. In affected Antigravity CLI releases, legacy command TOMLs are reported as converted but their wrapper commands are not discoverable; invoke the underlying namespaced skills directly. See [docs/antigravity-setup.md](docs/antigravity-setup.md#lifecycle-workflows-and-command-compatibility).

**Install from the repo:**

```bash
agy plugin install https://github.com/tinyc0der/agent-skills.git
```

**Install from a local clone:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tinyc0der/agent-skills.git
agy plugin install ./agent-skills
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Gemini CLI</b></summary>

Install as native skills for auto-discovery, or add to `GEMINI.md` for persistent context. See [docs/gemini-cli-setup.md](docs/gemini-cli-setup.md).

**Install from the repo:**

```bash
gemini skills install https://github.com/tinyc0der/agent-skills.git --path skills
```

**Install from a local clone:**

```bash
gemini skills install ./agent-skills/skills/
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Windsurf</b></summary>

Add skill contents to your Windsurf rules configuration. See [docs/windsurf-setup.md](docs/windsurf-setup.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>OpenCode</b></summary>

Copy skills to `.opencode/skills/` (or `~/.config/opencode/skills/`), add a project-local `AGENTS.md`, and use the built-in `skill` tool for agent-driven execution. Optional slash commands can be added under `.opencode/commands/`.

See [docs/opencode-setup.md](docs/opencode-setup.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>GitHub Copilot</b></summary>

Use agent definitions from `agents/` as Copilot personas and skill content in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. See [docs/copilot-setup.md](docs/copilot-setup.md).

Using the standalone `copilot` CLI? Install it as a plugin — see [docs/copilot-cli-setup.md](docs/copilot-cli-setup.md).

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Kiro IDE & CLI </b></summary>
  Skills for Kiro reside under ".kiro/skills/" and can be stored under Project or Global level. Kiro also supports Agents.md. See Kiro docs at https://kiro.dev/docs/skills/
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Codex</b></summary>

Install as a native Codex plugin (Codex CLI v0.122+):

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add tinyc0der/agent-skills
codex plugin add agent-skills@agent-skills
```

The first command registers the marketplace; the second installs the plugin. Codex reads the root `skills/` directory directly through `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`. Once installed, invoke skills in chat using `@` (e.g., `@spec-driven-development`). See [docs/codex-setup.md](docs/codex-setup.md) for local installation and troubleshooting.

To update the plugin, refresh the marketplace and reinstall:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace upgrade agent-skills
codex plugin add agent-skills@agent-skills
```

To uninstall the plugin and remove its local cache:

```bash
codex plugin remove agent-skills@agent-skills
```

Optionally, remove the marketplace registration too:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace remove agent-skills
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Grok Build</b></summary>

Install as a native Grok Build plugin:

```bash
grok plugin install tinyc0der/agent-skills
```

Accept the trust prompt, then start a new Grok session. Open `/skills` to browse the installed skills, or invoke one directly, such as `/spec-driven-development`. See [docs/grok-setup.md](docs/grok-setup.md) for local installation, verification, updates, removal, and troubleshooting.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Command Code</b></summary>

Install natively with the built-in `cmd skills` command. Command Code clones the repo, discovers every `SKILL.md`, and installs into `.commandcode/skills/`:

```bash
cmd skills add tinyc0der/agent-skills            # pick skills to install (project)
cmd skills add tinyc0der/agent-skills --global   # install for all projects (~/.commandcode/skills/)
cmd skills add tinyc0der/agent-skills -s spec-driven-development  # install a specific skill
```

Installed skills show up in the TUI slash menu, e.g. `/spec-driven-development`. See [docs/commandcode-setup.md](docs/commandcode-setup.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Other Agents</b></summary>

Skills are plain Markdown - they work with any agent that accepts system prompts or instruction files. See [docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md).

## Adoption

Already installed? How you roll the pack out depends on your codebase. The **[Adoption Guide](docs/adoption-guide.md)** covers two paths: the full lifecycle from day one for a greenfield project, or an incremental, verification-first rollout for an established codebase.

---

## All 30 Skills

The commands above are entry points. The pack includes 30 skills covering lifecycle work, discovery, harness reflection, and Orca phase delegation. Each skill is a structured workflow with steps, verification gates, and anti-rationalization tables. You can also reference any skill directly.

### Meta - Discover and coordinate workflows

| Skill | What It Does | Use When |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| [using-agent-skills](skills/using-agent-skills/SKILL.md) | Maps incoming work to the right skill workflow and defines shared operating rules | Starting a session or deciding which skill applies |
| [reflect](skills/reflect/SKILL.md) | Examines session evidence and makes scoped, verified improvements to skills, discovery, instructions, or tooling | Reflecting on a conversation or learning from repeated agent corrections |
| [delegate](skills/delegate/SKILL.md) | Delegates bounded tasks; preserves separate implementation and reviewer context through bounded follow-ups | One-shot delegation or coordinated phases with independent review and separate verification when required |

Ask “Reflect on this session and improve our harness” to use `reflect`. Add “review only” for proposals without file changes. Reflection can conclude that no change is justified; it does not run automatically after every task.

`delegate` requires Orca and its separately installed `orca-cli` skill; coordinated phases also require `orchestration`. One-shot handoffs return after confirmed prompt delivery. Automatic phase progression without an active coordinator wait requires verified runtime support for completion detection and durable notification delivery; the skill does not implement that capability. These dependencies are not bundled in this pack.

### Define - Clarify what to build

| Skill | What It Does | Use When |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| [interview-me](skills/interview-me/SKILL.md) | One-question-at-a-time interview that extracts what the user actually wants instead of what they think they should want, until ~95% confidence | The ask is underspecified, or the user invokes "interview me" / "grill me" |
| [idea-refine](skills/idea-refine/SKILL.md) | Structured divergent/convergent thinking to turn vague ideas into concrete proposals | You have a rough concept that needs exploration |
| [spec-driven-development](skills/spec-driven-development/SKILL.md) | Write a PRD covering objectives, commands, structure, code style, testing, and boundaries before any code | Starting a new project, feature, or significant change |
| [constraint-driven-development](skills/constraint-driven-development/SKILL.md) | Interviews you for a quality bar with sane default thresholds, writes CONSTRAINTS.md, places each check by cost, and catches agents silencing checks or skipping tests to get green | No standards are written down, or an agent is producing more than anyone reads |

### Plan - Break it down

| Skill | What It Does | Use When |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| [planning-and-task-breakdown](skills/planning-and-task-breakdown/SKILL.md) | Decompose specs into small, verifiable tasks with acceptance criteria and dependency ordering | You have a spec and need implementable units |

### Build - Write the code

| Skill | What It Does | Use When |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| [incremental-implementation](skills/incremental-implementation/SKILL.md) | Thin vertical slices - implement, test, verify, commit. Feature flags, safe defaults, rollback-friendly changes | Any change touching more than one file |
| [test-driven-development](skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md) | Stack-aware Red-Green-Refactor, Prove-It bug fixes, test readability, and browser verification | Implementing logic, fixing bugs, or changing behavior |
| [context-engineering](skills/context-engineering/SKILL.md) | Feed agents the right information at the right time - rules files, context packing, MCP integrations | Starting a session, switching tasks, or when output quality drops |
| [source-driven-development](skills/source-driven-development/SKILL.md) | Ground every framework decision in official documentation - verify, cite sources, flag what's unverified | You want authoritative, source-cited code for any framework or library |
| [doubt-driven-development](skills/doubt-driven-development/SKILL.md) | Adversarial fresh-context review of every non-trivial decision in-flight - CLAIM → EXTRACT → DOUBT → RECONCILE → STOP, with optional user-authorized cross-model escalation | Stakes are high (production, security, irreversible), working in unfamiliar code, or a confident output is cheaper to verify now than to debug later |
| [frontend-ui-engineering](skills/frontend-ui-engineering/SKILL.md) | Component architecture, design systems, state management, responsive design, WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility | Building or modifying user-facing interfaces |
| [api-and-interface-design](skills/api-and-interface-design/SKILL.md) | Contract-first design, Hyrum's Law, One-Version Rule, error semantics, boundary validation | Designing APIs, module boundaries, or public interfaces |

### Verify - Prove it works

| Skill | What It Does | Use When |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| [verification-and-validation](skills/verification-and-validation/SKILL.md) | Acceptance trace, repository gates, integrated runtime checks, and evidence-based readiness verdicts | Implementation is complete and needs feature-level verification before review |
| [browser-testing-with-devtools](skills/browser-testing-with-devtools/SKILL.md) | Chrome DevTools MCP for live runtime data - DOM inspection, console logs, network traces, performance profiling | Building or debugging anything that runs in a browser |
| [debugging-and-error-recovery](skills/debugging-and-error-recovery/SKILL.md) | Five-step triage: reproduce, localize, reduce, fix, guard. Stop-the-line rule, safe fallbacks | Tests fail, builds break, or behavior is unexpected |

### Review - Quality gates before merge

| Skill | What It Does | Use When |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| [test-case-design-review](skills/test-case-design-review/SKILL.md) | Minimum-sufficient test design and Keep/Merge/Rewrite/Remove/Add/Omit review | Planning, writing, pruning, or reviewing tests without prescribing TDD sequencing |
| [code-review-and-quality](skills/code-review-and-quality/SKILL.md) | Five-axis review, change sizing (~100 lines), severity labels (Nit/Optional/FYI), review speed norms, splitting strategies | Before merging any change |
| [code-simplification](skills/code-simplification/SKILL.md) | Chesterton's Fence, Rule of 500, reduce complexity while preserving exact behavior | Code works but is harder to read or maintain than it should be |
| [performance-optimization](skills/performance-optimization/SKILL.md) | Measure-first approach - Core Web Vitals targets, profiling workflows, bundle analysis, anti-pattern detection | Performance requirements exist or you suspect regressions |

### Cross-cutting - Active when their concern appears

| Skill | What It Does | Use When |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| [git-workflow-and-versioning](skills/git-workflow-and-versioning/SKILL.md) | Trunk-based development, atomic commits, draft/ready PR transitions, versioning | Branching, committing, opening a PR, merging, or releasing |
| [ci-cd-and-automation](skills/ci-cd-and-automation/SKILL.md) | Shift Left, Faster is Safer, feature flags, quality gate pipelines, failure feedback loops | Setting up or modifying build and deploy pipelines |
| [security-and-hardening](skills/security-and-hardening/SKILL.md) | OWASP Top 10 prevention, auth patterns, secrets management, dependency auditing, three-tier boundary system | Handling user input, auth, data storage, or external integrations |
| [documentation-and-adrs](skills/documentation-and-adrs/SKILL.md) | Architecture Decision Records, API docs, inline documentation standards - document the *why* | Making architectural decisions, changing APIs, or shipping features |
| [observability-and-instrumentation](skills/observability-and-instrumentation/SKILL.md) | Structured logging, RED metrics, OpenTelemetry tracing, symptom-based alerting - instrument as you build | Adding telemetry, or shipping anything that runs in production |

### Ship - Deploy with confidence

| Skill | What It Does | Use When |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| [deprecation-and-migration](skills/deprecation-and-migration/SKILL.md) | Code-as-liability mindset, compulsory vs advisory deprecation, migration patterns, zombie code removal | Removing old systems, migrating users, or sunsetting features |
| [shipping-and-launch](skills/shipping-and-launch/SKILL.md) | Pre-launch checklists, feature flag lifecycle, staged rollouts, rollback procedures, monitoring setup | Preparing to deploy to production |

---

## Agent Personas

Pre-configured specialist personas for targeted reviews:

| Agent | Role | Perspective |
|-------|------|-------------|
| [code-reviewer](agents/code-reviewer.md) | Senior Staff Engineer | Five-axis code review with "would a staff engineer approve this?" standard |
| [test-engineer](agents/test-engineer.md) | QA Specialist | Minimum-sufficient test strategy, coverage-gap analysis, and the Prove-It pattern |
| [security-auditor](agents/security-auditor.md) | Security Engineer | Vulnerability detection, threat modeling, OWASP assessment |
| [web-performance-auditor](agents/web-performance-auditor.md) | Web Performance Engineer | Core Web Vitals audit with Quick/Deep modes and a metric-honesty rule; run it via `/webperf` |

See [docs/agents.md](docs/agents.md) for the decision matrix, orchestration rules, and how personas compose with skills and slash commands.

---

## Reference Checklists

Quick-reference material that skills pull in when needed:

| Reference | Covers |
|-----------|--------|
| [definition-of-done.md](references/definition-of-done.md) | Project-wide standing bar every change clears, contrasted with per-task acceptance criteria |
| [testing-patterns.md](references/testing-patterns.md) | Test structure, naming, mocking, React/API/E2E examples, anti-patterns (JavaScript/TypeScript) |
| [security-checklist.md](references/security-checklist.md) | Pre-commit checks, auth, input validation, headers, CORS, OWASP Top 10 |
| [performance-checklist.md](references/performance-checklist.md) | Core Web Vitals targets, frontend/backend checklists, measurement commands |
| [accessibility-checklist.md](references/accessibility-checklist.md) | Keyboard nav, screen readers, visual design, ARIA, testing tools |
| [observability-checklist.md](references/observability-checklist.md) | On-call questions, structured logging, RED/USE metrics, tracing, symptom-based alerting, pre-launch gate |
| [orchestration-patterns.md](references/orchestration-patterns.md) | Endorsed multi-persona orchestration patterns, anti-patterns, and the "personas don't invoke personas" rule |

## How Skills Work

Every skill follows a consistent anatomy:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  SKILL.md                                       │
│                                                 │
│  ┌─ Frontmatter ─────────────────────────────┐  │
│  │ name: lowercase-hyphen-name               │  │
│  │ description: Guides agents through [task].│  │
│  │              Use when…                    │  │
│  └───────────────────────────────────────────┘  │                                                                                                
│  Overview         → What this skill does        │
│  When to Use      → Triggering conditions       │
│  Process          → Step-by-step workflow       │
│  Rationalizations → Excuses + rebuttals         │
│  Red Flags        → Signs something's wrong     │
│  Verification     → Evidence requirements       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key design choices:**

- **Process, not prose.** Skills are workflows agents follow, not reference docs they read. Each has steps, checkpoints, and exit criteria.
- **Anti-rationalization.** Every skill includes a table of common excuses agents use to skip steps (e.g., "I'll add tests later") with documented counter-arguments.
- **Verification is non-negotiable.** Every skill ends with evidence requirements - tests passing, build output, runtime data. "Seems right" is never sufficient.
- **Progressive disclosure.** The `SKILL.md` is the entry point. Supporting references load only when needed, keeping token usage minimal.

## Why Agent Skills?

AI coding agents default to the shortest path - which often means skipping specs, tests, security reviews, and the practices that make software reliable. Agent Skills gives agents structured workflows that enforce the same discipline senior engineers bring to production code.

Each skill encodes hard-won engineering judgment: *when* to write a spec, *what* to test, *how* to review, and *when* to ship. These aren't generic prompts - they're the kind of opinionated, process-driven workflows that separate production-quality work from prototype-quality work.

Skills bake in best practices from Google's engineering culture — including concepts from [Software Engineering at Google](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book) and Google's [engineering practices guide](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/). You'll find Hyrum's Law in API design, the Beyonce Rule and test pyramid in testing, change sizing and review speed norms in code review, Chesterton's Fence in simplification, trunk-based development in git workflow, Shift Left and feature flags in CI/CD, and a dedicated deprecation skill treating code as a liability. These aren't abstract principles — they're embedded directly into the step-by-step workflows agents follow.

## How it compares

Wondering how this stacks up against [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) or [Matt Pocock's skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills)? See **[docs/comparison.md](docs/comparison.md)** for an honest, side-by-side look at how the three are shaped differently and when to reach for each — including a link to a controlled [head-to-head experiment](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/superpowers-vs-agent-skills-faster-shipping-safer-reasoning-om-mishra-dzakf/).

---

## Contributing

Skills should be **specific** (actionable steps, not vague advice), **verifiable** (clear exit criteria with evidence requirements), **battle-tested** (based on real workflows), and **minimal** (only what's needed to guide the agent).

See [docs/skill-anatomy.md](docs/skill-anatomy.md) for the format specification and [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.
