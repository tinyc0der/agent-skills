description: Simplify code for clarity and maintainability — reduce complexity without changing behavior

Invoke the agent-skills:code-simplification skill.

**Workflow notes:** For an active track, read `docs/tracks/<track-id>/notes.md` at phase entry or resume and update it when useful context changes or before handoff. Capture observations, tentative ideas, outcomes, blockers, and next actions with evidence links. Follow the memory-management running-note and document-metadata protocols; honor explicit read-only or file-scope limits and keep writes outside pinned verification or release targets.

Simplify recently changed code (or the specified scope) while preserving exact behavior:

1. Read CLAUDE.md and study project conventions
2. Identify the target code — recent changes unless a broader scope is specified
3. Understand the code's purpose, callers, edge cases, and test coverage before touching it
4. Scan for simplification opportunities:
   - Deep nesting → guard clauses or extracted helpers
   - Long functions → split by responsibility
   - Nested ternaries → if/else or switch
   - Generic names → descriptive names
   - Duplicated logic → shared functions
   - Dead code → remove after confirming
5. Apply each simplification incrementally — run tests after each change
6. Verify all tests pass, the build succeeds, and the diff is clean

If tests fail after a simplification, revert that change and reconsider. Use `code-review-and-quality` to review the result.
